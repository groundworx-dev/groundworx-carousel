== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use custom blocks inside each slide? =  
Yes, the Carousel block supports all inner blocks inside each `Slide` block.

= Does it support touch and swipe? =  
Yes. Splide.js provides full touch/swipe navigation on mobile and tablet.

= Can I disable the carousel for a specific breakpoint? =  
Absolutely. You can "destroy" the carousel at selected breakpoints and apply a grid layout instead.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.0.0 =  
First stable release of the Groundworx Carousel block.

== Developer Notes ==

= Can I add my own block variations? =  
Yes. The Carousel block is built with extensibility in mind. You can register your own block variations using `wp.blocks.registerBlockVariation()` in JavaScript. All Splide options are passed as-is through the `splideOptions` attribute.

However, `supports` (such as `arrowStyle` or `paginationStyle`) cannot be set via variation definition. To customize those, you must use a filter like `blocks.registerBlockType`.

Example (variation):

```js
wp.blocks.registerBlockVariation('groundworx/carousel', {
    name: 'minimal-style',
    title: 'Minimal Style',
    attributes: {
        template: 'minimal',
        splideOptions: {
            type: 'fade',
            arrows: true,
            pagination: false
        }
    },
    isDefault: false
});

```
